# note-taker
## Description
### This application was created with the purpose of creating a responsive note taking app where the user will be able to save and delete notes as they choose. In order to complete this project, I built the back end to connect to the starter code drive front end. This app utilizes the npm Express package for it's back end functionality.

## Usage & back end creation
### I began by creating seperate files to contain the api and the html routes in an effort to keep the server.js file organized. These js files hold all of the app's get, post, and delete requests.
